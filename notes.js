! 2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
?-> 1. A library is a collection of functions developers can call at will and still control the flow of the software application. The operations performed to be performed by libraries are precisely and specifically defined.
?   2. A framework is a structure in which the application defines the content of the operation by asking the developer to fill in the spaces. The framework defines the concept with the functionality itself is defined by the developer with the end-user in mind.
?   3.Frameworks and libraries are code written by third parties to solve regular/common problems or to optimise performance. A key difference between the two is the inversion of control. When using a library, the control remains with the developer who tells the application when to call library functions. When using a framework, the control is reversed, which means that the framework tells the developer where code needs to be provided and calls it as it requires.

! What is CDN? Why do we use it?
? A Content Delivery Network or a CDN is a globally-distributed network of servers that helps provide high-availability, faster performance, and security to websites distributing their content via it.
! Why do we use it?
? 1. Increasing Availability - For simplicity, availability can be considered a simple measure of how long your website and its functions remain accessible in a given period.With a CDN coming into the picture, it does two things. One, a lot of traffic doesn't even come to your servers. The edge server of the CDN serves a lot of content from its cache. So, you need a slightly fewer number of servers.
? Second, as long as the content is available in the CDNs cache, even if your actual servers are not working, the CDN will keep serving the content. This gives you some buffer time to fix issues on your servers while the CDN serves whatever content it can from its cache.
? 2. Website Security

! ● Why is React known as React?
? React was developed for applications (Facebook) that have constantly changing data. Since React is a front-end framework or the “View” in MVC, this means that as the user clicks around and changes the app's data, the view should “react” or change with those user events.
