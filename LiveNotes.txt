// Chapter 01 - Inception

/** Read about these. **/
1. What is CDN?
2. What is CrossOrigin?
3. What is the diff between async vs defer?


//  Chapter 02 - Igniting our App 
1. How do we understand if it is a prod ready server?
Ans -> ● Minify our file -> remove console.logs, bundle things up..
       ● need a server to run 
       ● optimization->clean console-> bundle 

# Bundlers are packages. If we want to use a package in our code, we have to use a 'package manager' -> npm OR yarn

/** Read about these. **/
    ● Webpack
    ● Parcel
    ● Vite
    ● create-react-app uses which bundlers?

# Bundlers -->  ● minify code ● remove console.log 

# Command to install npm 
    ● npm init
    ● package name: yourPackagename
    ● version: yourVersionname
    ● description: Project description
    ● entry point: App.js or any entry point of your Project
    ● test command: jest
    ● git repository: git url
    ● keywords:________
    ● author: Itu Mandal
    ● license: (ISC)

    Is this ok? Yes


# How to install parcel?
● npm i -D parcel  OR npm install --save-dev parcel

// Dev dependency means all the packages that the project needs

# parcel :'^2.8.2'
# Read about Caret vs tilds (^/~)

# package-lock.json
● tells us the exact version we are using -> locks the version of package
● never put in git ignore
● always put in git project

#package.json--> the latest version and if we use ^ then it will automatically update to latest version of that package.

# node_modules -> database of your npm, always add to .gitignore file


#npm i react
#npm i react-dom


# IGNITE OUR APP 
● npx parcel index.html
// it will launch a server for us -> http://localhost:1234

// <script type ='module' src='App.js'></script>


## ****  PARCEL  **** ##
● Parcel is a beast - Akshay Saini
● HMR - Hot Module Replacement
● File Watcher Algorithm (C++) 
● Minification
● Bundled
● Dev & prod build
● Super fast build algorithm
● image optimization
● caching while development
● compression
● compatible with older version of browser
● HTTPS on dev --> npx parcel index.html --https
● manages port number
● consitent hashing algorithm
● Zero config

# How to run prod server from parcel ?
Ans -> npx parcel build index.html

# should we put .parcel-cache in git-ignore? Why
Ans -> YES , anything which we can be auto generated in server, can be put in gitignore file

# why is React app fast?
Ans -> ● Virtual dom
        ● Parcel
        ● dependencies -> bundlers

## Transitive dependencies --> we have our package manager which handles and takes care of our transitive dependency of our code. Meaning 1 dependency and then inside that other dependency and then inside that 2 other dependencies and the list goes on.. This entire process is known as Transitive dependencies.

## Interview Ques ● How do you build a prod ready app?

# browserlist:--> it is used to make our code compatible for older browsers
    'browserslist': [
        'last 2 versions'
    ]

# How many diff types of script in HTML?
